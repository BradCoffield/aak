title: Teaching Statement
---

 
<p>As a teacher of writing and literature, I seek to emulate for my students those character traits that make us all better readers, writers, and thinkers: intellectual curiosity, genuine commitment, a willingness to take risks, and a passion for revision. My classroom is a place where all students, regardless of their level of skill and familiarity, can feel comfortable and welcome, a place where they can engage with others in the serious yet open pursuit of making meaning.</p>

<p>I have enjoyed teaching under- and upperclassmen, traditional and nontraditional students, writing workshops, literature surveys, and freshman composition courses. My favorite course to teach, by far, is the one that surprises students&mdash;surprises them because they learn something unexpected about their abilities, because they begin to see old ideas in a fresh light, because they embrace subjects they&rsquo;ve previously considered not worth their time.</p>

<p>In 2016 I co-founded a creative writing group for student veterans and service members at Duquesne University, the DU Dog Tags Literary Society. In 2017 I led a creative writing group at a local vet center; this project served U.S. veterans and their adult family members and was supported by a generous grant from Pennsylvania Council on the Arts.
