                 <div class="small-10 small-centered columns"><p><span class="paragraphlede">One of my biggest teaching triumphs</span> occurred at the end of a semester of freshman composition, when a student dramatically proclaimed, “You’ve ruined Britney Spears for me!” She was referring to our much earlier analysis of the video for Spears’s song “…Baby One More Time,” when we’d dissected the video’s portrayal of gender roles by analyzing its visual techniques. The other students agreed: they could no longer enjoy a music video without considering its various contexts, methods, and aims. The class was scandalized; I was thrilled. Of course it’s not my goal to ruin anything for my students—quite the opposite, actually—but it is my goal to help them make the leap from passive observers of the world to involved participants. In the discipline of English, this means developing students’ ability to delve beyond surfaces, question what they find, consider multiple perspectives, and actively engage in making meaning. I do this in my courses by creating a safe and inviting learning environment, emphasizing collaboration, strengthening students’ critical and creative thinking abilities simultaneously, and modeling learning as a process.  </p>

<p>I want my classroom to be an inviting place where students feel safe expressing their ideas, asking questions, and taking intellectual risks. Creating such a space starts with little things: chatting with students before class begins, poking fun at myself for misspelling on the board, learning each student’s name by the end of the second day. This last example shows students that I value and respect them as individuals and, usually within a few weeks, all but the most inhibited and disengaged individuals refer to one another by name, significantly increasing the level of respect students have for their peers and one another’s perspectives. Ultimately, this mutual respect lends to the free and open discussion of ideas, which is essential to what and how one learns in the English classroom: while students know they’ll be challenged to support their arguments and hone their skills, they must feel confident they’ll never be derided nor judged for their opinions or abilities. To this end, I daily offer positive reinforcement of student participation, praising strong and thoughtful responses as well as less developed ones that nonetheless demonstrate a student’s intellectual curiosity or willingness to engage with difficult ideas. Genuine, encouraging feedback demonstrates to students that they are really being heard and that they can trust me and their peers with their thoughts.  </p>

<p>A safe learning environment provides the bedrock for collaboration, which depends on students’ engagement with and investment in the course material, one another, and me. I consistently encourage students to meet with me during office hours, I respond quickly to their e-mails, and I stay after class to answer questions, all of which demonstrates that (as one SES comment noted) I “care about students and if they underst[an]d topics.” By being approachable and available to collaborate with students on their learning, I show that I am invested in them, which, in turn, motivates their investment in me and our classroom community. This community thrives on interaction, and I work diligently to prepare dynamic lessons centered on class discussions, partnered writing exercises, small group analyses of readings, and other activities in which students share their knowledge, push their intellectual boundaries, and integrate ideas. To introduce the concept of subjective definition in freshman composition, for example, I lead the class through a categorization of different activities (e.g., baseball, cheerleading, skateboarding) as either “sport” or “athletic but not a sport.” Enthusiastically registering their votes as I mark them on the white board, students offer competing reasons for one categorization or the other, and, together—usually with much laughter—we discover the difficulty of writing a definition of sport that satisfies everyone. Because this topic interests nearly all students (if only because some detest sports!), the activity engages the whole class in the process of meaning making.  </p>

<p>My belief that meaning is made, not found, informs my efforts to develop students’ critical and creative thinking abilities in tandem through reading, writing, and discussion. In fact, I believe that true critical thinking is creative thinking, and vice versa. In the literature classroom, I employ in-class group writing exercises, rather than lecture, to introduce students to the historical, social, and ideological contexts that will frame our forthcoming discussions of literary texts. One such activity asks students in small groups to write a story (complete with characters and a title) using key terms they’ve defined individually outside of class. To do so, they must synthesize seemingly disparate but ultimately related concepts and construct a narrative to present to their peers. Whereas lecture “tells” students key information to absorb and retain, this activity asks them to interact with the information, to help make it mean. And the groups’ presentations provide the prime opportunity for me and other class members to offer additional comments, correctives, or questions—to extend the collaborative weaving of critical and creative thought. I also encourage this multi-faceted thinking in written assignments by, for example, going beyond the “traditional” with composition papers that allow students to select formats like magazine articles, blog posts, and speeches or to write from someone else’s point of view (such as an individual of a different socioeconomic group). By moving beyond the standard essay format or outside their own perspectives, students can imaginatively engage with somewhat conventional topics; this enables them to stop worrying about what they’re “supposed” to think/write about their subject and initiates the exploration of fresh ideas.  </p>

<p>Finally, I hope to spur my students’ continual exploration of new ideas by modeling for them that learning is an ongoing process. My approach to giving feedback on student’s written work is particularly helpful in accomplishing this goal. Whether written or verbal, this feedback is never limited to the piece at hand. Rather it takes into account the student’s entire body of work: previous drafts of the assignment, earlier papers, comments made in class, questions posed during office hours, and so on. Even things that may seem unrelated are fodder. By using all of these intellectual products to comment on and critique a given piece of writing, I demonstrate to students how they are continually building knowledge and skills, how they’ve strengthened their abilities, made conceptual leaps, taken greater risks. They are then more easily able to draw connections between where they “were” and where they “are” now and to conceive of where they want to go with their writing and thinking in the future. Moreover, this tactic has proven especially helpful for struggling students because it helps them to see “beyond” the grade earned by a given assignment or the troubles marring a particular draft.  </p>

<p>Thinking of my former students as they mourned their lost ability to take MTV and YouTube at face value, I imagine, with some pride, how those lessons may have trickled into other aspects of their lives. The learning process is, of course, life-long, continuing well beyond an individual classroom—something I remind my students of time and again. By creating an environment in which my students feel safe expressing their views, collaborating with one another and me in the exploration of new ideas, and challenging themselves critically and creatively, I establish the important foundations for that learning process in my courses. And when students walk out of the classroom on the last day of the semester, it’s as much a beginning as it is an end.  </p>
