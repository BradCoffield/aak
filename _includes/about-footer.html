                    <h2>About</h2>
                </header>
                <p>I hold a PhD in English literature from Duquesne University, where I taught courses in American literature, creative writing, and composition and served as the Assistant Director of the Writing Center. In 2009 I earned an MFA in fiction from Penn State University and in 2004 a BA in English writing and history from the University of Pittsburgh. I'm currently Assistant Professor of Creative Writing at Rocky Mountain College.</p>
<p>
                    My training as a creative writer informs my critical attention to literary form and narrative theory as well as my pedagogical approach to texts both literary and nonliterary. My recent critical work considers post-9/11 American war fiction by Ben Fountain, Phil Klay, and David Abrams in the context of government, military, and media discourses about the Iraq War and the ever-evolving legacy of the Vietnam War. I also study U.S. poetry, drama, and fiction from throughout the twentieth century as well as post-WWII British fiction and poetry.</p>
                    <p>
                    A native of southwestern PA, I now live in Billings, MT where I enjoy working out, thrift shopping, and home improvement projects.</p>
