        Do you feel wobbly when it comes to grammar, punctuation, and mechanics?
        Are you worried that your ideas don’t “flow”? Or that your text is too
        wordy or repetitive? Maybe you’re just looking to spice up a dull passage
        on p. 14? You’ve come to the right place!
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I have more than a dozen years of experience editing and proofreading
        academic and general interest work—including second-language (ESL)
        work—across a wide range of disciplines: accounting, art history, biology,
        chemistry, economics, education, engineering, finance, history, religion,
        technology, etc. I’ve worked on dissertations, master’s theses, magazine
        articles, journal articles, academic monographs, self-help books, and
        websites.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        On top of all this, I am, by training and trade, a writer—both scholarly
        and creative—and I love (love [love]) the written word. I bring that
        passion and excitement to all projects I work on.

          I’ll provide a *free* sample edit (up to 5 pages). That way you can see my
          work in action and I can offer an estimate on the number of hours your
          project will require.
